# 🚀 PromptiFy — AI Prompt Storage Server

PromptiFy is a lightweight, modular Node.js + MongoDB API server designed to securely store, categorize, and manage AI prompts for advanced users, developers, red teamers, and researchers.

It serves as a personal prompt vault — built to organize reusable AI instructions (prompts) for tasks like jailbreaks, writing, automation, security testing, and more. Whether you’re building AI tools, testing model limitations, or maintaining prompt libraries — PromptiFy keeps everything structured, tagged, and accessible.
